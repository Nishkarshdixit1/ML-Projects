The "Petrol Price in India" dataset available on Kaggle contains information about the prices of petrol, a type of fuel, in India over time. The dataset includes several fields, including "month-year", which provides the date of the petrol price; "opening", which represents the price of petrol at the beginning of the day; "closing", which represents the price of petrol at the end of the day; "highest", which represents the highest price of petrol reached during the day; and "lowest", which represents the lowest price of petrol reached during the day.

The dataset provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in analyzing petrol prices in India over time. For instance, researchers may use this dataset to identify trends in petrol prices, explore the impact of various factors such as global crude oil prices and government policies on petrol prices, or even develop predictive models to forecast future petrol prices in India.
